Welcome to ASMLevel15
==================================================

To interact with any level you will send raw bytes over stdin to this program.
To efficiently solve these problems, first run it to see the challenge instructions.
Then craft, assemble, and pipe your bytes to this program.

For instance, if you write your assembly code in the file asm.S, you can assemble that to an object file:
  as -o asm.o asm.S

Note that if you want to use Intel syntax for x86 (which, of course, you do), you'll need to add the following to the start of asm.S:
  .intel_syntax noprefix

Then, you can copy the .text section (your code) to the file asm.bin:
  objcopy -O binary --only-section=.text asm.o asm.bin

And finally, send that to the challenge:
  cat ./asm.bin | /challenge/run

You can even run this as one command:
  as -o asm.o asm.S && objcopy -O binary --only-section=.text ./asm.o ./asm.bin && cat ./asm.bin | /challenge/run

We will now set some values in memory dynamically before each run. On each run
the values will change. This means you will need to do some type of formulaic
operation with registers. We will tell you which registers are set beforehand
and where you should put the result. In most cases, its rax.

In this level you will be working with memory. This will require you to read or write
to things stored linearly in memory. If you are confused, go look at the linear
addressing module in 'ike. You may also be asked to dereference things, possibly multiple
times, to things we dynamically put in memory for your use.



Recall that registers in x86_64 are 64 bits wide, meaning they can store 64 bits.

Similarly, each memory location can be treated as a 64 bit value.

We refer to something that is 64 bits (8 bytes) as a quad word.

Here is the breakdown of the names of memory sizes:
  Quad Word   = 8 Bytes = 64 bits
  Double Word = 4 bytes = 32 bits
  Word        = 2 bytes = 16 bits
  Byte        = 1 byte  = 8 bits

In x86_64, you can access each of these sizes when dereferencing an address, just like using
bigger or smaller register accesses:
  mov al, [address]        <=>        moves the least significant byte from address to rax
  mov ax, [address]        <=>        moves the least significant word from address to rax
  mov eax, [address]       <=>        moves the least significant double word from address to rax
  mov rax, [address]       <=>        moves the full quad word from address to rax

Remember that moving into al does not fully clear the upper bytes.

Please perform the following:
  Set rax to the byte at 0x404000
