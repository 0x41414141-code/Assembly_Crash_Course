Welcome to ASMLevel28
==================================================

To interact with any level you will send raw bytes over stdin to this program.
To efficiently solve these problems, first run it to see the challenge instructions.
Then craft, assemble, and pipe your bytes to this program.

For instance, if you write your assembly code in the file asm.S, you can assemble that to an object file:
  as -o asm.o asm.S

Note that if you want to use Intel syntax for x86 (which, of course, you do), you'll need to add the following to the start of asm.S:
  .intel_syntax noprefix

Then, you can copy the .text section (your code) to the file asm.bin:
  objcopy -O binary --only-section=.text asm.o asm.bin

And finally, send that to the challenge:
  cat ./asm.bin | /challenge/run

You can even run this as one command:
  as -o asm.o asm.S && objcopy -O binary --only-section=.text ./asm.o ./asm.bin && cat ./asm.bin | /challenge/run

In this level you will be working with control flow manipulation. This involves using instructions
to both indirectly and directly control the special register `rip`, the instruction pointer.
You will use instructions such as: jmp, call, cmp, and their alternatives to implement the requested behavior.

We will be testing your code multiple times in this level with dynamic values! This means we will
be running your code in a variety of random ways to verify that the logic is robust enough to
survive normal use.



In previous levels you discovered the for-loop to iterate for a *number* of times, both dynamically and
statically known, but what happens when you want to iterate until you meet a condition?

A second loop structure exists called the while-loop to fill this demand.

In the while-loop you iterate until a condition is met.

As an example, say we had a location in memory with adjacent numbers and we wanted
to get the average of all the numbers until we find one bigger or equal to 0xff:
  average = 0
  i = 0
  while x[i] < 0xff:
    average += x[i]
    i += 1
  average /= i

Using the above knowledge, please perform the following:
  Count the consecutive non-zero bytes in a contiguous region of memory, where:
    rdi = memory address of the 1st byte
    rax = number of consecutive non-zero bytes

Additionally, if rdi = 0, then set rax = 0 (we will check)!

An example test-case, let:
  rdi = 0x1000
  [0x1000] = 0x41
  [0x1001] = 0x42
  [0x1002] = 0x43
  [0x1003] = 0x00

then: rax = 3 should be set

We will now run multiple tests on your code, here is an example run:
  (data) [0x404000] = {10 random bytes},
  rdi = 0x404000
