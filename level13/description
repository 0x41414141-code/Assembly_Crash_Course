Welcome to ASMLevel13
==================================================

To interact with any level you will send raw bytes over stdin to this program.
To efficiently solve these problems, first run it to see the challenge instructions.
Then craft, assemble, and pipe your bytes to this program.

For instance, if you write your assembly code in the file asm.S, you can assemble that to an object file:
  as -o asm.o asm.S

Note that if you want to use Intel syntax for x86 (which, of course, you do), you'll need to add the following to the start of asm.S:
  .intel_syntax noprefix

Then, you can copy the .text section (your code) to the file asm.bin:
  objcopy -O binary --only-section=.text asm.o asm.bin

And finally, send that to the challenge:
  cat ./asm.bin | /challenge/run

You can even run this as one command:
  as -o asm.o asm.S && objcopy -O binary --only-section=.text ./asm.o ./asm.bin && cat ./asm.bin | /challenge/run

We will now set some values in memory dynamically before each run. On each run
the values will change. This means you will need to do some type of formulaic
operation with registers. We will tell you which registers are set beforehand
and where you should put the result. In most cases, its rax.

In this level you will be working with memory. This will require you to read or write
to things stored linearly in memory. If you are confused, go look at the linear
addressing module in 'ike. You may also be asked to dereference things, possibly multiple
times, to things we dynamically put in memory for your use.



Please perform the following:
  Place the value stored in rax to 0x404000
